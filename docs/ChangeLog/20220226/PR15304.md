### Split Common core now supports Pointing Devices ([#15304](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/15304))

Pointing devices can now be shared across a split keyboard with support for a single pointing device or a pointing device on each side.

This feature can be enabled with `#define SPLIT_POINTING_ENABLE` and one of the following options:

| Setting                   | Description                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
|`POINTING_DEVICE_LEFT`     | Pointing device on the left side   |
|`POINTING_DEVICE_RIGHT`    | Pointing device on the right side  |
|`POINTING_DEVICE_COMBINED` | Pointing device on both sides      |

See the [Pointing Device](../feature_pointing_device.md) documentation for further configuration options.
